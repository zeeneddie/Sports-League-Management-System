## Quick Start

### For Developers
1. Read [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md) for high-level understanding
2. Follow [Development Setup](development/setup.md) to get started
3. Review [API Endpoints](api/endpoints.md) for integration details
4. Check [Carousel System](frontend/carousel-system.md) for frontend architecture

### For DevOps/Infrastructure
1. Review [Tech Stack](architecture/tech-stack.md) for infrastructure requirements
2. Follow [Production Deployment](deployment/production.md) guide
3. Configure [Monitoring](deployment/monitoring.md) and observability
4. Review [Security](security/overview.md) configuration

### For Product/Business
1. Start with [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md)
2. Review [Data Flow](architecture/data-flow.md) to understand data sources
3. Check [API Documentation](api/endpoints.md) for available data

## System Summary

**SPMS** is a simplified sports league management dashboard built with Flask that displays Dutch football league data in a rotating carousel format. Key characteristics:

### Core Features
- **6-screen carousel dashboard** with automatic rotation (10-second intervals)
- **Real-time data integration** from hollandsevelden.nl API
- **Automated scheduling** - daily updates at 10:00 AM, Saturday updates every 30 minutes (16:00-19:00)
- **Test/Production modes** with fallback data strategies
- **Security-first design** with CSRF protection, security headers, and CSP
- **Bootstrap 5 responsive UI** with extensive team logo support

### Architecture Highlights
- **Stateless Flask application** with JSON caching layer
- **Background scheduler** using Python `schedule` library
- **External API integration** with robust error handling and fallbacks
- **Modular data processing** pipeline for different dashboard views
- **Zero-database architecture** with file-based data persistence
- **Production-ready security** with comprehensive HTTP security headers

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: hollandsevelden.nl API (Dutch regional football data)
- **Fallback**: Static test data for development and API failures
- **Cached**: JSON file storage with automatic refresh cycles

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths âœ…
- **Working production system** with live data integration
- **Clean separation of concerns** between data fetching, processing, and presentation
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Security-conscious implementation** with modern web security practices
- **Responsive design** with extensive asset library (team logos, icons)
- **Test mode support** for development and testing

### Areas for Enhancement ðŸ”„
- **Data persistence** currently relies on JSON files (see [BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md))
- **Monitoring and observability** limited to basic logging
- **Testing coverage** needs expansion for production readiness
- **API rate limiting** and advanced resilience patterns
- **Database integration** for more robust data management

## Key Metrics & Performance

### Current Performance Profile
- **Response time**: Sub-200ms for cached data
- **Data freshness**: Maximum 30 minutes during active periods
- **Carousel performance**: 10-second rotation with smooth transitions
- **Asset optimization**: 500+ team logos efficiently served
- **Security score**: A+ rating with comprehensive headers and CSRF protection

### Scalability Characteristics
- **Concurrent users**: Suitable for small-to-medium deployments (100-500 concurrent)
- **Data volume**: Optimized for regional league data (20-30 teams per competition)
- **Update frequency**: Configurable scheduling system
- **Resource usage**: Minimal server requirements due to caching strategy

## Next Steps for Multi-Team Enhancement

Based on this documentation baseline, the recommended approach for multi-team implementation enhancement:

1. **Phase 1**: Infrastructure Foundation
   - Database migration from JSON to PostgreSQL/Redis
   - Monitoring and observability stack implementation
   - Comprehensive test suite development

2. **Phase 2**: Multi-Team Architecture
   - Dynamic team configuration system
   - Multi-league data source integration
   - Enhanced data processing pipeline

3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Features
   - Real-time notifications and alerts
   - Advanced analytics and reporting
   - Performance optimization and scaling

See [BACKLOG.md](../BACKLOG.md) for detailed implementation roadmap and [system-overview.md](architecture/system-overview.md) for architectural guidance.
